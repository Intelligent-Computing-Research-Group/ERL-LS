# ERL-LS
This is the source codes for our paper "ERL-LS: Accelerating the Optimization of Logic Synthesis with Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning".
As a asynchronous parallel framework for reinforcement learning, ERL can be applied to various on-policy RL-based method and thus getting a better efficiency.
